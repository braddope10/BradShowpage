            During the course of my academic career, 
            I also managed to accrue nearly 6 years of work experience. 
            Most recently, I have had the privilege of working for 
            Kora Trucking as an Automotive Technician Assistant, 
            where I learned valuable professional skills 
            such as customer needs assessment, record management, and workflow planning. 
            Being a fluent <strong>Spanish speaker</strong>, Itâ€™s been a pleasure learning new business vocabulary 
            where I had a lot of personal growth in my communication skills as I work with many Spanish speaking clients.
