            A little about myself. 
            <br />
            <br />
            My name is <strong>Bradley Lopez</strong> , I am a detail-oriented college student currently attending College of Southern Nevada in 
            Las Vegas for <strong>Computing & Information Technology</strong> where I am in the process of obtaining an associates degree and I also obtain a certification in <strong>Full-Stack 
            Software Engineering</strong> through a 600+ hour course at Flatiron School.
            <br />
            <br />
            During the course of my academic career, I also managed to accrue nearly 6 years of work experience. 
            <br />
            <br />
            Most recently, I have had the privilege of working for <strong>Lopez Brothers</strong> as an Automotive Technician Assistant, 
            where I learned valuable professional skills such as customer 
            needs assessment, record management, and workflow planning.
