            <h3>Hello, my name is Bradley Lopez!</h3>
            A little about myself. I am a detail-oriented college student currently attending College of Southern Nevada 
            in Las Vegas for Computing & Information Technology and in the process of receiving my certification in Full-Stack 
            Software Engineering through a 600+ hour course at Flatiron School. During the course of my academic career, 
            I also managed to accrue nearly 6 years of work experience. Most recently, I have had the privilege of working for 
            Lopez Brothers as an Automotive Technician Assistant, where I learned valuable professional skills such as customer 
            needs assessment, record management, and workflow planning.
